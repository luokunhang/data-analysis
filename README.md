### This repository hosts five data analysis projects of AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis

1. Application of Time frequency Analysis - Imaging and locating.pdf

This is a project focused on time-frequency Fourier analysis. [Code](AMath1.m)

2. Gabor Transform - Analysis of Audio Clips.pdf

This reports demonstrates how wavelet transform on audio file processes signals. [Code Part I](AMath2_1.m) [Code Part II](AMath2_2.m)

3. Principal Component Analysis on Moving Objects.pdf

This reports shows the process of handling raw video data and uses PCA to reduce dimensions of the moving objects in the video. [Code Part I](AMath3.m) [Code Part II](AMath3_horizontal.m) [Code Part III](AMath3_rotation.m) [Code Part IV](AMath3_noise.m)

4. Facial Features Extraction and Music Genre Recognition with Machine Learning.pdf

This project paper illustrates the extraction of facial features and how machine learning models distinguish genres of music. [Code Part I](AMath4.m) [Code Part II](AMath4_1.m)

5. Dynamic Mode Decomposition - Separating Foreground from Background.pdf

The ultimate projects of the course showcases the PCA and eigenvalue transform can separate the static background from the dynamic objects. [Code](AMath5.m)
